# BSCS25108_ProductWebsite
This is a repository of my project. I learned Html css and java script.applied them on my project.I created a clothing brand named RS Clothing
and used a bright color home picture.This brand website consists of 3 main pages.Number 1 the cover page 2 the prodcuts where all the products are displayed and 3 contact us where the user has to input his details.i used javascript to add pop up welcome message and to show year at the footer.The products tell if they are in stock or not.I used different colors and tried to make my website as professional as possible.In the footer of all pages there are links of my accounts.
